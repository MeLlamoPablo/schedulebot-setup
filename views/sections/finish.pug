p That's all! You may now deploy your bot!

p #[strong Note]: if you're running this on Heroku, after you press the deploy button, this website will shut down itself so the bot can run. This means that after the deployment, you won't be able to change anything here. In order to enter the setup mode again you can use the #[strong schedulebot-admin setup] command.

p If you're not running on Heroku, you'll need to manually run the bot with #[strong npm run bot].
