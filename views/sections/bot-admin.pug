h1 Setting up the bot admin
p Bot admins are Discord users who are allowed to execute any admin command, including adding or removing additional admins.
p You should set your own Discord user as the first bot admin; more admins can be added later.
p You need to introduce the Discord's user ID. To get that, go to Discord's user settings, then "#[i Appearance]", then check "#[i Developer Mode]". After that, right click on your username, and click "#[i Copy ID]".
