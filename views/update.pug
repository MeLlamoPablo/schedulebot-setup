mixin updateSectionContent()

	p You're about to update from version #[span(id="span-current-version")] to version #[span(id="span-new-version")]. You can check what's new in the #[a(href="https://github.com/MeLlamoPablo/schedulebot/releases" target="_blank") changelog].

	p If you're running on Heroku, updating the bot to the new version will shut down this Update site, and will tell Heroku to download the latest version. After the update is over, the bot will be turned on again.

	p That means that this site will stop responding. In order to check the progress of the update, go to your #[a(href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/") Heroku Dashboard].

	p If you're not running on Heroku, the database will be automatically updated for you, but you'll need to manually update your working copy by simply executing #[strong git pull].
